Your page should display the following:

- The page title = The Simpsons. Both in the header and a heading.
- All sections should have a `heading` at the top
- An image of the Simpsons logo
- A list of links to Simpsons fan sites
- An "About" section with a paragraph that briefly describes the show
- A Characters section that displays a featured character of the week
- A "Quotes" section that has a list of quotes from the Simpsons

#### Styling

Style your page so that...

- it has a light blue background color
- the logo is centered, has a border, and its size is appropriate for the page
- the headers for each of the sections are centered, bold and a dark color which is different from your normal text
- the slogan section has a border around it
- there are 10 pixels of space between each section

#### Page behavior

The provided code includes an `Edit me!` button in the HTML and some code in `main.js` that lets us execute the code in the `makeEdits` function when the `Edit me!` button is clicked. Add your code in the `makeEdits` function! Remember that you can refresh your page to return it to its initial state.

For this section, feel free to add classes or ids to your existing HTML.

When `Edit me!` is clicked...

- the background color of the page changes to some other color of your choosing
- a new character of the week of your choosing should appear within the character section, in place of the original
- the first quote is deleted from the page
